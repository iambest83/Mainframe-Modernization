Mainframe systems have been the backbone of enterprise computing for decades, renowned for their reliability, performance, and security. However, the evolving business landscape demands agility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness, prompting organizations to explore cloud-based solutions. Major technology companies, including cloud providers and system integrators, have invested heavily in mainframe migration practices, recognizing the significance of this transformation.

Mainframes and cloud computing each have their strengths and specific use cases. It's not fair to generalize either, and in practice, a hybrid approach is common. This post will explore a practical solution for mainframe workload migration using a hybrid pattern, where certain workloads move to the cloud while still interacting with on-premises applications and data sources.

I aim to provide an end-to-end workflow with detailed, hands-on information necessary for implementing production-ready solutions. The focus is on migrating a mainframe workload to IBM Cloud, but the solution remains cloud-agnostic. To emphasize this, I'll conclude with a reference architecture for AWS.

This documentation takes a solutions architect's perspective, outlining a mainframe workload migration. While some standard assumptions are made for simplicity, the scenario remains realistic. The post also covers a multi-zone deployment strategy for high availability and disaster recovery.


Do note that we will not be diving into the aspects of code transformations and database migrations in this section.
